# Deployment-of-BERT-GPT-models-on-web-server
This is a project to practice MLOps. Implement a flask application with UI web page to generate next sentence using BERT and GPT models 

# Snapshots
Beginning page is where user type in arbitrary starting sentence and maximum length of generation, like below:

After clicking the submit button, the result page will show after the generation is done. This may take two minutes. See screenshot below:

Try the A/B test 
For a random user, the web page shows a random generation from either BERT or GPT-3. See the screenshot below:
